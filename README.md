# Mycitrus App Interface V4(Version 5)

## Summary

This is the fourth prototype for the interface of the mycitrus app that I am working on. I have added a color scheme and have changed the header stylings to be more consistent. I have also added new fonts in version 3. In version 4 I added screen switching and created a hook that calls for article data when the app loads. In version 5 the body text and titles of articles was made reactive to the data in the useArticles hook.

## Build

This app uses React Native and the Expo managed workflow created with the blank template(non-typescript).

## Final Comments and Notes

- There is screenswitching in the current version but all the assets are static except the title
- All infomation is premade in JSON data files
