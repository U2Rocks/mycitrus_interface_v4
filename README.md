# Mycitrus App Interface V4(Version 3)

## Summary

This is the fourth prototype for the interface of the mycitrus app that I am working on. I have added a color scheme and have changed the header stylings to be more consistent. I have also added new fonts in version 3.

## Build

This app uses React Native and the Expo managed workflow created with the blank template(non-typescript).

## Final Comments and Notes

- There is no screen switching capabilities in this early prototype
- All infomation is premade in JSON data files
